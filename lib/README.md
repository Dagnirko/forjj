# Common Build env functions

This directory contains common functions called at source time in
bin/shell scripts.

# TODO

In order to share the same code and stabilize it, we will need to
centralize this file with a procedure to update the source code
from the central build-env repo.

In that way, the build-env can get fixes easily, reproducible.

I imagine to define which kind of project to may be generate such files
in bin/ like glide/go or inenv.

If the project type Golang, to maintain this Golang build env.
